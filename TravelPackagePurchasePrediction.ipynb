        "\n",
        "**Visit with us** is a tourism company that wants to understand its existing business model and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base by introducing new package deals.\n",
        "\n",
        " Currently, there are five types of packages the company offers - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the last year's data, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was relatively high because customers were contacted randomly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The company is now planning to launch a new product, i.e., Wellness Tourism Package. Wellness Tourism is defined as Travel that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance or kick-start a healthy lifestyle and support or increase one's sense of well-being.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a Data Scientist at **\"Visit with us\"** travel company, I have to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel \n",

        "Understanding consumer behavior can quite chanlenging, especially when the product we offer our customers is a service and a leisure in this case. To derive meaningful insights, I will perform the following:\n",

        "\n",
        "- Prepare the data for visualization using a customized  module wrangle.py\n",
        "- Visualize the data\n",
        "- Identify patterns and insights \n",
        "- Document key observations and relationships between variables \n",
        "- Build machine models \n",

        "My goal in this project is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify the characteristics of customers who are more likely to purchase a new travel package deal, and the potential reasons for this behavior.\n",
        "- Build a ML model To predict which customer is more likely to purchase the newly introduced travel package.\n",
        "- Build Bagging classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Tree\n",
        "- Build Adaboost, GradientBoost, XGBoost, and Stacking classifiers\n",
        "- Make recommendations are made based on the findings to help increase the chances of creating a customer base for the new product .\n",

        "* What are unique characteristics of our customers?\n",
        "* What factors increase their chances of purchasing a travel plan ?\n",
